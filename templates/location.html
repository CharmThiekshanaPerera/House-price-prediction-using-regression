        <p>Location plays a crucial role in determining house prices. Our model considers the quartile zone of the house location to provide accurate predictions. The quartile zone is determined based on the desirability and amenities available in the area.</p>
        <p>Whether the house is located in a prime area or a developing neighborhood, our model takes into account the location's impact on the house price.</p>
